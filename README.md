## Algorithmic Trading Bot Created With Statistical Arbitrage

This is an algorithmic trading project created by taking two stock data, one leading and one lagging, and using statistical arbitrage. What I will do in this project is to determine the leading stock data and trade the lagging stock according to its movement. As a result, two graphs will be created.

I will build the project using Python. I will use the Quandl API to access stock data. And I will use pandas and numpy when collecting and cleaning data, and matplotlib libraries when creating graphs. I will run the model I created on the Backtrader platform.

I chose the Technology Sector for my project and the Lead and Lag data I will use are as follows:
Leading: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)
Lagging: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
